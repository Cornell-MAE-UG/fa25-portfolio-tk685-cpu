My name is Taehee Kim, and I am 2nd year mechanical engineering student minoring in ECE and business. For now, I don't know specifically what I want to do in the future but I generally love learning new things that are in the realm of engineering. For hobbies, I like climbing, running, and playing boardgames with friends.
